# How To Make a django project:
Step1:install django in the local machin by "pip install django"
Step2: django-admin startproject Project-name

## How to make a app instide the project :
> python manage.py startapp appname

## how to run DJANGO setup:
> python manage.py runserver

## How to make frontend or add frontend to the project:

```
First of all make a dir in the main folder then connect the directory to the settings.py Templates section now add the fortend portion in templates and then connect them via views.py and urls.py
```

## How to get data from a request:

You can get data from a request using the `request.GET` or `request.POST` dictionaries.

**GET:**
```python
def counter(request):
    # Use .get() to avoid errors if the key doesn't exist
    name = request.GET.get('name', '')  # The second argument is the default value
    age = request.GET.get('age', '')
    content = {
        'name': name,
        'age': age
    }
    return render(request, 'counter.html',content)
```

**POST:**
To get data from a POST request, you need to include a CSRF token in your form.

```html
<form method="POST" action="counter" >
    {% csrf_token %}
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name"><br>
    <input type="text" name="age" placeholder="Enter your age"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
</form>
```

Then, in your `views.py`, you can access the data from `request.POST`:

```python
def counter(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.POST.get('name', '')
        age = request.POST.get('age', '')
    else:
        name = request.GET.get('name', '')
        age = request.GET.get('age', '')

    content = {
        'name': name,
        'age': age
    }
    return render(request, 'counter.html', content)
```

## What is a CSRF token and why is it important?

CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. A CSRF token is a unique, secret, unpredictable value that is generated by the server and sent to the client. The client then includes this token in any subsequent requests. This ensures that the request is coming from the original site and not from a malicious third party.

In Django, you can add a CSRF token to your forms using the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag.

## What is the difference between `GET` and `POST`?

- **GET:** Used to request data from a specified resource.
  - Data is sent in the URL as query parameters (e.g., `?name=John&age=30`).
  - Can be bookmarked and cached.
  - Should not be used for sensitive data.
- **POST:** Used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
  - Data is sent in the request body.
  - Cannot be bookmarked or cached.
  - More secure than GET for sending sensitive data.

## How to connect URLs between the project and the app:

In your main project's `urls.py` (`dProject/urls.py`), you can use the `include()` function to delegate URL routing to your app's `urls.py` (`myapp/urls.py`).

**dProject/urls.py:**
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('myapp.urls')),  # Include URLs from myapp
]
```

This tells Django that for any URL that doesn't match `/admin/`, it should look for further instructions in `myapp/urls.py`.

## What is a 'view' and what is its role?

A view is a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. The response can be the HTML contents of a web page, a redirect, a 404 error, an XML document, or an image.

Views are where the main logic of your application is located. They process the user's request, interact with the database (if necessary), and generate the response.

## What is a 'template' and how does it work?

A template is a file that contains the static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.

In your project, the `frontEnd` directory contains your templates. The `render()` function in your views takes a template file and a dictionary of data (called the "context") and returns an `HttpResponse` object with the rendered text.

**Example:**
```python
# In views.py
def index(request):
    context = {'name': 'Viscous'}
    return render(request, 'index.html', context)
```

```html
<!-- In index.html -->
<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
```

When this template is rendered, `{{ name }}` will be replaced with "Viscous".

## How to add css in the frontend:
1.Make a diff dir called static
2.```
import os in settings.py
```
3.Add this:
```
STATIC_URL = 'static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
```
4.Add css files in static folder and in html connect them with 

```
{% load static %}

<link rel="stylesheet href="{% static 'style.css' }">
```
