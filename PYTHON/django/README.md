## How to get data from a request:

You can get data from a request using the `request.GET` or `request.POST` dictionaries.

**GET:**
```python
def counter(request):
    # Use .get() to avoid errors if the key doesn't exist
    name = request.GET.get('name', '')  # The second argument is the default value
    age = request.GET.get('age', '')
    content = {
        'name': name,
        'age': age
    }
    return render(request, 'counter.html',content)
```

**POST:**
To get data from a POST request, you need to include a CSRF token in your form.

```html
<form method="POST" action="counter" >
    {% csrf_token %}
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name"><br>
    <input type="text" name="age" placeholder="Enter your age"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
</form>
```

Then, in your `views.py`, you can access the data from `request.POST`:

```python
def counter(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.POST.get('name', '')
        age = request.POST.get('age', '')
    else:
        name = request.GET.get('name', '')
        age = request.GET.get('age', '')

    content = {
        'name': name,
        'age': age
    }
    return render(request, 'counter.html', content)
```

## What is a CSRF token and why is it important?

CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. A CSRF token is a unique, secret, unpredictable value that is generated by the server and sent to the client. The client then includes this token in any subsequent requests. This ensures that the request is coming from the original site and not from a malicious third party.

In Django, you can add a CSRF token to your forms using the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag.
